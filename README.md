A game where children can practice their writing skills by drawing letters and numbers using their cursor.

### Objective
Draw App is an educational game for children where they can practice their writing skills by drawing letters and numbers using their cursor. The app uses a deep learning model to recognize the child's drawing and determine if it matches the letter/number that was asked to draw. If the drawing is accurate, the app provides a fixed score.

### Gameplay
Upon starting the app, the child will be presented with a blank canvas and a letter/number to draw. The child will use their cursor to draw the letter/number on the canvas. As they draw, the app will use a deep learning model to recognize the strokes and determine if the drawing matches the letter/number that was asked to draw. If the drawing is accurate, the app will provide a fixed score.

### Scoring
The app's scoring system is based on whether or not the child's drawing matches the correct form of the letter/number. If the drawing is accurate, the app provides a fixed score.
